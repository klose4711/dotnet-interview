# Senior Developer Refactoring Excercise

## About

This codebase forms the baseline for a refactoring discussion. The intended usage is to give the Interviewee 10-20 Minutes to familiarize with Application.cs and SqlRequest.cs and then have a 10 Minute discussion about refactoring it, lead by the questions in Application.cs's head doc.

This is not a Test!
This is supposed to be done in casual conversation!

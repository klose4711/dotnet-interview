# Java App Refactoring 🚀

Your task today:

* Take a look and try to understand what this app is doing. Try to get it running.
* If there are any problems, try to fix them.
* If there is bad code, feel free to refactor it.
* Please tell us what you are doing and what your ideas are, so that we can follow you.
* This project is a .net core 2.1 console application.

There is an `OutofScope...` class in this codebase. That class is not supposed to be refactored, it just simulates accessing a database. Looking at it will let you understand what sort of data you will be dealing with. Since the application we are refactoring is a reporting application we will not be wasting any time thinking about how the data gets into the database. We just read it into our app.

A couple of key points:

* This is not a test! There is no "master" solution. We just want to get an overall picture of you working with code.
* Just pretend it is your first working day and this is your task. You can do everything you would normally do (including use Google, Stackoverflow or ask us for help).
* This is supposed to be done in casual conversation, relax and tell us your opinion about the questions.
* We do pair programming here and this interview is not different, so if there is anything you need help with, please ask.
* You can use your favorite IDE.
